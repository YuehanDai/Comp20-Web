## Questions

**What was the easiest part of this assignment?**

The easiest part for me is to draw a simple layout of the web design, like the tone, composition, and the logos, and the image is kind of easy for me since I can use my own design and my own images. 

**What was the most challenging part of this assignment?**

I spend a lot of time to make the alignments and the compositions (adjusting the styles in CSS), and another thing that is challenging for me is to make up the information and the text materials.
